                            Children are assessed and supported to reach individualized developmental goals in a playful, interactive environment based on Early Start Denver Model (ESDM model).
                            HASS provides a family-orientated, child-centered approach. Our children learn through fun activities. Observing children happily engaging in the school program is also encouraging for parents.

                            The purpose of Hope Autism Welfare Society is to improve the quality of life for children
                            with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their families.
                            In order to accomplish their goal, this internationally recognized organization provides
                            comprehensive, evidence-based diagnostic assessment by renowned ASD specialists
                            and therapeutic intervention by trained doctors and therapists.</p><br>
                           <p> On a nonresidential admission basis Hope Autism Welfare Society is providing one-one

                            <p>As the seat capacity is limited, other children who come up to this center are served on
                            appointment basis at regular interval by our experts.
                            Vocational wing of Hope autism Center is another noteworthy venture, where these
                            special children are being trained for being self-dependent. Their hand made quality
                            products/ foods are being sold regularly both indoor &amp; outdoor with the goal to ensure
                                active community participation.</p><br>
                            <p>Apart from ASD, Hope Autism Welfare Society also deals any child with delay in their
                            normal development e.g language delay &amp; provide intensive services to them for
                            reaching to their full potentials.
                            Although clinical care is the primary mission of this center, it also serves training
                            facilities for professionals and care givers, provided chiefly by International ADOS
                                trainer Dr. Nusrat Yasmeen Ahmed, founder of this center.</p><br>
                        <p>

                            We are proud of our children on the spectrum. Their love is unconditional, so is their
                            presence.
